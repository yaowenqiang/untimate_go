"If most computer people lack understanding and knowledge, then what they will select will also be lacking" - Alan Kay
"The software business is one of the few places we teach people to write before we teach them to read" - Torn Love(inventor of Objective C)
"Programming is, among other things, a kind of writing. One way to learn writing is to write, but in all other forms of writing, one also reads. We need examples both good and bad to facilitate learning. But how many programmers learn to write program by reading programs?" - Gerald M.Weinberg

"There are two kinds of software projects: those that fail, and those that turn into legacy horrors." - Peter Weinberger (Inventor of AWK)

"The hardest bugs are those where you mental model of the situation is just wrong, so you can't see the problem at all." - Brian Kernighan
"Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place, So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it,how will you ever debug it ?" - Brian Kernighan

"Debuggers  don't remove bugs, They only show them in slow motion." - Unknown

"The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness. Other observers had noted this for some time before. indeed the trend was becomming obvious as early as 1980." - Niklaus Wirth

"The hardware folks will not put more cores into their hardware if the software isn't going to use them. so, it is this balancing act of eacher other staring as each other.and we are hoping that Go is going to break through on the software side。“　－　Rick Hudson(2015)


"C is the best balanc I've ever seen between power and expressiveness. You can do almost anything you want to do by programming fairly straightforwardly and you will have a very good mental model of what's going to happen on the machine. you can predicat reasonably wll how quickly it's going to run. you understand what's going on ... Brain Kernighan(2000)"


"Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order." - Wes Dyer

"Good engineering is less abouting finding the 'perfect' solution and more about understanding the tradeoffs and being able to explain them." - JBD

"The correctness of the implementation is the most important concern. but there is no royal road to correctness. It involves diverse tasks such as thinking of invariants. testing and code reviews. Optimization should be done. but not prematurely." - Alaho(inventor of AWK)


"Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means there's no glanmorous work. You don't get to show off your amazing skills. You just build something that gets the job done and then move on. This approach may not earn you oohs and aahs, but lets ou get on with it." - Jason Fried


## Integrity

There are two driving forces behind integrity

+ Integrity is about every allocation, read and write of memory being accuratte. consistent and efficient. The type system is critical to making sure we have this micro level of integrity
+ Integrity is about every data transformation being accurate, consistent and efficnent. Writing less code and error handling is critical to making sure we have this micro level of intergity



## Write less code.

There have been studies that have researched the number of bugs you can expect to have in your softwae. The industry average is around 10 to 50 bugs per 1000 lines of code. One simple way to resuce the number of bugs, and increase the intergity of your software is to write less code.




"Failure is expected, failure is not an odd case. Design systems that help you identify failure, Designe systems that can recover from failure." - JBO

"Product excellence is the difference between something that only works under certain conditions, and something that only breaks under certain conditions. " - Kelsey Hightower

"Making things easy to do is a false economy, Focus on making things easy to understand and the rest will follow. " - Peter Bourgon



"Implicit conversion of types is the Halloween special of coding. Whoever thought of them deserves their own special hell." - Martin Thompson
